This is an assignment for a program design and construction university paper. 

While currently functional, there is room for improvement. For example, as it currently exists, if you login with the same username as a previous game and you were partway through a game earlier, it will continue with the same game. However, if your previous game finishes, when you log in with the same username it will not generate a new game for you and will be continue from week 15 (which is the cut off for the game end) and the game will finish after only one action.
